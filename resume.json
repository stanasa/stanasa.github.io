In my association with him, he is one of the most perceptive and forward-thinking technical professional I have come across. He is a natural leader whose skills encompass both the technical know how and managerial abilities.\n\nSince Ryan joined Social Security Administration (SSA) - he has been instrumental in planning, reengineering, and developing the Agency's strategic plans. He has worked in numerous complex and mission critical assignments such as strategizing and planning for the health IT initiatives, business process reengineering, and the development of the SSA long-term vision.\n\nAbove all, he has a very pleasant disposition and energetic personality. I highly recommend him.",

Selected candidates are provided rotational leadership experiences throughout the Social Security Administration and have access to the Agency's upper-level executive leadership team. The candidates are selected based on their overall IT skills, ability to think differently and creatively about how to solve large-scale government information technology challenges, as well as demonstrate a commitment to service.\n\nActing as the #2 official for the Agency, I was on the selection committee that offered Ryan a Fellowship. Ryan exhibits all of these characteristics and is an excellent IT professional. We developed a professional relationship that continues to this day. While Ryan will surely excel in any career path he chooses, I personally hope he stays in public service. The government needs people like Ryan Harvey.",
